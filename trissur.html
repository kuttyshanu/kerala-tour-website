        <p>Thrissur Pooram, often termed as the festival of festivals in Kerala is held in Thrissur, a northern district of Kerala. The word pooram literally means group or meeting. The tradition has that every year the Gods and Goddesses residing at temples in the neighbouring regions come together for a day of celebration at the famous Vadakkumnatha Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva. This coming together is led from the front by Goddess Bhagavati, and Lord Krishna, presiding deities of Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi temples, located close to the Vadakkumnatha Temple. The sprawling Thekkinkadu grounds around the Vadakkumnatha Temple become the rendezvous for gods and goddesses from adjoining temples.</p>

            <p>Guruvayur is home to the historic Sree Krishna Temple, called the Dwaraka of the South. It is among the most revered and popular pilgrimage destinations in Kerala and the entire country. The central shrine is believed to have been rebuilt in 1638 C.E.

            <p>Kerala Kalamandalam has, for decades, been regarded as the most prestigious Kathakali school in the entire world. This legendary school of art is located in Cheruthuruthy and was originally set up by the famous poet of Malayalam, Vallathol Narayana Menon. The story goes that he recognised a subtle decrease in the interest people had in Kathakali and other traditional art forms and thus started the venture. Today, the Kalamandalam is the foremost proponent of a variety of traditional performing art forms that include Mohiniyattam, Kutiyattam, Thullal and Nangiarkoothu. It is also an official deemed University for Art and Culture.</p>
