          <p>Munroe Island is a hidden pearl in the backwaters which is composed of a cluster of 8 islands. Each of them is separated by small water channels and lakes. Munroe Island is located about 27 km from Kollam. The place is named in honour of Resident Colonel John Munroe, of the former princely state of Travancore. He is said to have integrated several backwater regions by digging canals.</p>

            <p>From the firmament it appeared like the unfurling petals of a rose. Amidst the petals, rests a valley in the Shenduruney forest. The little green patches of land, spilled across the river, with its bewitching aura seem to have come down from a fairy tale. Welcome to Rosemala, a valley that abounds in the bounty of nature. The shape of the land akin to that of a rose flower might be the reason behind the name of this valley. </p>
